A simple twist on the classic game 'Snake'

Green Fruit - Eat the green fruit to grow your snake and grow larger!

Red Fruit - Avoid the red fruit, it will half your score & dramatically increase the length of your snake, making the game more difficult.

Yellow Fruit - Be on the look out for yellow fruit! It gives a bonus 3 points and reduces the size of your snake, making the game easier.

Bonus Pickup - Collect rare bonus pick up to give a temporary double points to score for 10 seconds.

Click 'Run' to start the game and use your directional keys to control the snake.
